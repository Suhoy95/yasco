## Preface

This is moment, when you are studying [SNE](https://os3.su/), doing Virtual Machine
Management lab with Cloud Orchestration. But it is the last night before deadline,
And figuring out the other orchestration systems is too late, and I'm doubting
about its design and clearness. So It is better to use brute force and
DO IT YOURSELF with python.
